    "text": "Hello guys!\nToday I want to talk about RUFF, my default formatter (and much more) for Python language.\nIn a nutshell RUFF can be seen as tool that performs all theses tasks:\nRUFF = Flake8 + isort + black + pydocstyle + pyupgrade + autoflake\nFlake8 = Linter, which fix style + syntax errors\nisort = Sort the imports\nblack = formatter ; PEP8 complaint. Ex.: line-length: 88; Single/Double quotes; empty lines; parenthesis\npydocstyle = docstrings\npyupgrade = upgrade syntax for newer versions of python packages\nautoflake = Remove unused imports and unused variables\nSo, instead of heaving to set up each one individually, use RUFF and have all these tools into a single one. RUFF was written in rust, so it is not a wrap of the previous mentioned. Also, it is a way faster than the previous tools."

Therefore, having a .vscode/settings.json inside of the folder of your project guarantees that everyone will use the same formatter:\n\nI also make Ruff as a default extension:\n\nLast but not least, you can also install ruff and your environment and implement it on your CI/CD routines. But it will not be covered in here. Installing the extension and using the .vscode/settings.json guarantees that the suggestions will be made on the fly. But it depends on VsCode."

    "text": "Bonus (Caveat)\nOne thing that I struggled to start using a tool like this was because I used to write code in a single long line. I always received the warning E501: line-too-long from my black. It happens when the number of characters in a line was longer that 79 characters, which is the recommendation in PEP 8. After applying a tool like ruff my code changed drastically (as it would force to break lines), and it was uncomfortable in the beginning. So, I started to relax the parameter of the line-length a little bit (from 79 to for example, 150 characters), and started to analyze the impact of change. Then I realized that the impact on my previous code was not large at all.\nLeaving the limit as the default, PEP 8 argues that you can open multiple files side by side, being also easier to see the git diff changes.\nAnyway, if you think that this limit is small, you can relax it a little bit globally, doing it by:\n\nor skipping this rule by adding # fmt: skip in the end of a line. Or using #fmt: on in the beginning of a block and #fmt: off in the end.\nHappy coding."
